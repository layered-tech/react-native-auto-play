const getUserPrompt = (title, description, diff) => {
  return {
    role: 'user',
    content: `Review the code changes in the diff below. Follow these rules strictly:

## What to Review
1. Major bugs and logic errors
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Thread-safety issues
4. Best-practice violations (only significant ones)
5. Typos in code (variable names, strings) - not in comments or descriptions

## What NOT to Review
1. Test files (*.test.ts) - use them only as context
2. Minor style issues or nitpicks
3. Issues that linters or TypeScript would catch
4. Positive feedback - only report problems
5. Missing documentation or comments - EXCEPT the stale-documentation cases listed below

## Stale Documentation (always report these)
These are the one documentation exception. Report each as an issue on the changed source
line, saying which file needs updating and why.

1. Public API, installation or host-app setup changed, but packages/react-native-autoplay/README.md
   was not updated. That README is the only documentation consumers get. Watch for renames
   or changes to: the getRootViewForAutoplay AppDelegate method, any *SceneDelegate class
   name (they are referenced by string from the consumer's Info.plist), any
   ReactNativeAutoPlay_* Gradle property or its default, entitlements, URL schemes, the
   ProGuard rule, setIconFont, or any exported symbol in src/index.ts.
2. An architectural rule or invariant changed, but AGENTS.md was not updated. AGENTS.md is
   the agent instruction file. Its "Rules" section states hard rules (NitroModules
   only, committed nitrogen/generated/ output, tag-derived version, both platform branches
   of an action config) and its "Common tasks" section has step lists for adding a native
   method and adding a template. If the diff changes any of those, the rule or step list is
   now wrong.
3. A docs file changed but the skill that summarises it did not. These pairs must agree:
     - docs/native-modules.md       <-> .skills/nitro-native-modules/SKILL.md
     - docs/templates.md            <-> .skills/autoplay-templates/SKILL.md
     - docs/host-app-integration.md <-> .skills/host-app-integration/SKILL.md
   Each SKILL.md summarises rather than reproduces its doc, so absence is NOT a problem:
   do not report a detail for being missing from a summary. Report only a CONTRADICTION -
   the summary forbidding what the doc permits, or naming a path, command or default the
   doc contradicts. Quote both versions that disagree.
4. Behaviour described in docs/*.md changed but the doc did not. Those files document
   non-obvious behaviour and silent failure modes; a diff that changes one makes the doc
   actively misleading.
5. A new template was added without both when-branches in AndroidAutoScreen.kt, or without
   an export from src/index.ts. This compiles and fails at runtime.
6. AGENTS.md grew past ~16 KB. Tools truncate it there, so anything past the limit is
   invisible. New task-specific content belongs in docs/.

## PR Description
Report it as an issue if the PR description is long prose, a walkthrough of the diff, or a
per-file account. Descriptions should be short and high level - a few bullets on what
changed and why, with one bullet per feature or fix. This applies to AI-written PRs too.
Do not report this if the description is already brief, or if the author states they were
asked for more detail.

## Output Format
Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact structure:
{
  "summary": "Brief 1-2 sentence summary of findings, or 'No significant issues found.' if none",
  "issues": [
    {
      "filePath": "full/path/to/file.ts",
      "lineContent": "exact line content copied from the diff",
      "comment": "Brief explanation of the issue"
    }
  ]
}

## lineContent Rules (IMPORTANT for line matching)
The lineContent field is used to find the exact line number in the file. Follow these rules:
1. Copy the line EXACTLY as it appears in the diff (including leading whitespace/indentation)
2. Prefer a SINGLE line when possible - this gives the most precise match
3. For multi-line issues, include just enough lines to uniquely identify the location
4. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or modify the line content

## GitHub Suggestions
When you can propose a concrete code fix (typos, simple bugs, improvements), use GitHub's suggestion syntax in the comment field:
\`\`\`suggestion
corrected code here
\`\`\`

IMPORTANT: Preserve the EXACT indentation from the original line in your suggestion. The suggestion replaces the entire line, so wrong indentation will break the code.

Example for a typo fix (notice the 2-space indent is preserved):
{
  "filePath": "src/utils.ts",
  "lineContent": "  const nubmer = 42;",
  "comment": "Typo in variable name:\n\`\`\`suggestion\n  const number = 42;\n\`\`\`"
}

Only use suggestions when you have a specific fix. For general issues without a clear fix, just explain the problem.

If there are no issues, return: {"summary": "No significant issues found.", "issues": []}

${title ? `## PR Title\n${title}\n\n` : ''}${description ? `## PR Description\n${description}\n\n` : ''}## Diff
