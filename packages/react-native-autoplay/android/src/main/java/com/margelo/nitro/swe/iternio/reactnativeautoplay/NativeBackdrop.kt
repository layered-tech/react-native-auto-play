 * An optional host-app-provided native View rendered under the React surface of an
 * Android Auto display (root or cluster) — the Android counterpart of the iOS
 * `getRootViewForAutoplay` AppDelegate hook. Lets a host compose a native map beneath its React overlay, e.g. a
 * native map view that cannot be hosted as a React Native view on the virtual display
 * (Fragment-based map SDK wrappers are bound to the phone Activity).
 *
 * Contract: register `NativeBackdropRegistry.factory` before the CarAppService starts
 * (Application.onCreate). The factory is consulted once per presentation (i.e. again after
 * every surface resize); each backdrop is destroyed when its presentation is replaced or the
 * renderer stops. A factory that throws is logged and ignored — the surface still renders.
