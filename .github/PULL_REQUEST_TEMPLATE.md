<!--
Keep the sections that fit and delete the rest — a one-line PR does not need all of them.
Titles follow `fix:` / `feat:` / `chore:` / `docs:` with an optional scope.

Keep the whole description short and high level. Bullets, not prose. If the PR carries
several features or fixes, give each one its own bullet rather than a paragraph. This
applies to PRs written with AI too — write at length only if explicitly asked to.
-->

## Summary

<!--
A few high-level bullets: what changed and why. One bullet per feature or fix.
Not a walkthrough of the diff, not a per-file account.
-->

## Problem

<!--
For bug fixes: the symptom, then the root cause. Name the hardware, OS and tool versions
you reproduced on — "Galaxy S25 / Android 16", "Xcode 26.4", "iOS 27" — since most bugs
here are host-specific. Delete this section for straightforward features.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
For new API: why it's needed and what was impossible before. Link the Apple / Google
documentation for the platform feature being wrapped. Delete for bug fixes.
-->

## Usage

<!-- New or changed public API: a short snippet showing the call. Delete if none. -->

## Screenshots / recordings

<!--
Required for anything visible on a car surface. One per template or surface, captioned
with what it shows and on which platform. Head-unit screenshots or a screen recording
from the Desktop Head Unit / CarPlay Simulator are the norm here.
-->

## Test plan

<!-- Checkboxes. Say which platform and which head unit or simulator. -->

- [ ] Tested on Android Auto (Desktop Head Unit / real head unit — say which)
- [ ] Tested on CarPlay (Xcode CarPlay Simulator / real head unit — say which)

## Checklist

<!-- Delete rows that don't apply. -->

- [ ] `yarn lint:auto-play` and `yarn typecheck:auto-play` pass (plus `:example` if the
      example app changed)
- [ ] **Native code goes through NitroModules** — no TurboModule, `TurboReactPackage`,
      `ReactContextBaseJavaModule`, `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE` or `NativeModules` lookup
- [ ] Any `src/specs/*.nitro.ts` change was followed by `yarn specs`, and the regenerated
      `nitrogen/generated/` output is **committed in this PR**
- [ ] New or changed native methods are implemented on **both** iOS (Swift) and Android
      (Kotlin), or deliberately no-op on one via the `?.` pattern
- [ ] A new template updates **both** `when` branches in `AndroidAutoScreen.kt` (back-action
      lookup and construction) and is exported from `src/index.ts`
- [ ] Action / `HeaderActions` configs fill in **both** the `ios` and `android` branches
- [ ] `package.json` version is **not** hand-edited (the release workflow sets it from the tag)
- [ ] Contributor docs updated if behaviour changed: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/*`, `.skills/*`
