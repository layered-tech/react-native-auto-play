/**
 * This is an alternative entry point that demonstrates how to use
 * HybridAutoPlay.isCarServiceRunning() to prevent heavy JS initialization
 * during notification-only headless starts on Android.
 *
 * Problem:
 * On Android, both Android Auto and Firebase notifications can start the app
 * process headlessly. In both cases index.js executes and all top-level imports
 * are evaluated eagerly — including the Redux store, middleware, and other side
 * effects. These keep the process alive after the notification is handled,
 * wasting resources and battery.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Use isCarServiceRunning() to distinguish between headless starts triggered by
 * Android Auto / CarPlay and those triggered by other sources (e.g. notifications).
 * Heavy modules are loaded via lazy require() calls that only execute when actually
 * needed — either when the car service is running, when the user opens the app
 * (Activity triggers runApplication), or when AA/CP connects later.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 * 1. App starts first, then AA/CP connects:
 *    - else branch taken, lazy component provider registered
 *    - Activity renders -> provider executes, loads store/App/car listeners
 *    - didConnect fires later -> car templates created
 *
 * 2. AA/CP starts without app open (headless):
 *    - if branch taken, everything loads immediately
 *    - Car UI works, phone UI mounts later if Activity starts
 *
 * 3. Notification comes in, no app, no AA/CP:
 *    - else branch taken, but component provider never called (no Activity)
 *    - didConnect never fires (no car)
 *    - No require() calls execute -> store/middleware never load -> clean exit
 *
 * 4. Notification comes in, then app or AA/CP starts shortly after:
 *    - else branch taken initially (lightweight)
 *    - Activity or didConnect triggers lazy loading when needed
